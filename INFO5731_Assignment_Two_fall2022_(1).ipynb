            "[<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say \"I was bored\" by it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.<br/><br/>The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.<br/><br/>The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal \"loud\" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.<br/><br/>Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial \"I can't do it\" until they can.<br/><br/>In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it. There are a bunch of unneeded \"deux-ex machina\" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that's what happens when you get the 2021 \"Mortal Kombat\", \"WW84\" and \"The Expendables\" writers).<br/><br/>Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst \"acting\" I've ever seen and a same type of joke (\"awkward nonsense\") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief.<br/><br/>But... Liu is actually pretty good as a lead (and his character is potentially great), and the \"Shang-Chi world\" is beautiful and it has everything to be super fun to watch in the future...without Awkwafine and better writers.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Destin Daniel Cretton's 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography, but the film misses a solid storyline for an origin story as its titular character lacks personality and does not go through any heroic transformation story arc. Simu Liu has a strong presence as Shang-Chi, yet he is overshadowed by many of his more experienced co-stars.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.<br/><br/>It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Everything comes in it beautiful science fiction and beautiful mythical creatures. Sometimes you have creatures that don't seem real, but these just seemed real. Well done! There was a bit of avatar feeling in it. Fighting for the safekeeping of peace. Really beautiful. And self-acceptance was also nicely incorporated.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I'll be honest - Marvel movies are not in my top 20 or even 50 but within the Marvel \"Universe\" I would say that Shang-Chi is in my top 5. I know, it's blasphemy and all that but think about it - is it better than Iron Man? I would admit yes - it's origin story is arguably better, and it's characters are a lot deeper. The Mandarin is a conflicted man, with evil but good as well, like real life. Is this movie better than The Avengers or Ragnarok or Infinity Wars? Hard to say, which means it's right up there with the best (of Marvel) in my opinion.<br/><br/>Plus, I'm a sucker for Chinese movies with the Chinese language being spoken - 1 of my favourite of all times, if not my absolute favourite, is of course 'Hero.' The Chinese language and the artistry of it's culture are magnificent.<br/><br/>All in all, well done Marvel, director Destin, and all those who worked to make this movie a reality. This is not just your average summer action movie; it's close to being a Masterpiece. And the humour is pretty swell too!<br/><br/>Cheers.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Shang-Chi is a boring film. The characters were okay, but the story was choppy and confusing. The song choices were odd. Plus, this movie was way too long. And the scene at the end had me practically falling asleep.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Watched the IMAX version! Best solo since Iron Man (2008)! I had no expectations of this before. But the movie is much more lively. Enjoyed every moment. And also very engaging from start to finish. A kinda Cute-Action movie with some fun stuff!<br/><br/>This is the first movie that focuses more on martial arts than Marvel's superpower thing. Love to see a mix of Marvel's MASTER-LEVEL-CGI with Martial art. Kung-Fu with this kind of visual effect! Marvel nailed it again.<br/><br/>I've always loved Marvel's casting. Katy is too perfect for her role. Loved her chemistry with Shaun. Also laughed out loud at her childish stuffs.<br/><br/>Just one thing, not a big deal, the action scene of 'Dragon Riding' doesn't fit into the usual Marvel movie. But as Chinese flavor, it is OK. Except for this, the cinematography and VFX are a lot mesmerizing!</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view. It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.<br/><br/>The plot/story however is mediocre and filled with plot holes... the characters' actions are often unrealistic and they will often just 'stare in awe' at their friends being killed, instead of doing the realistic thing, and immediately defending their friends... it's something that happens like 5 times and honestly spoils the movie for me.... if characters in a movie don't act or react realistically and stare at something like a braindead zombie (like their friends getting killed right in front of them, whilst they are holding a gun in their freeking hands), then it's just really terrible script/plot writing.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie isn't as bad as Ant-Man 2 but it's not far behind. Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie. I roll my eyes at everything Awkwafina's character does in the movie.<br/><br/>It's a 5/10 movie, not really worth a watch unless you're a real die-hard Marvel fan.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">RATED 8/10\n",
            "Language: English\n",
            "Source: Hotstar\n",
            "RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>The story and making is worth to watch in big screen with good sound system. The first half is filled with great actions and funny moments and it get into serious mode in the second half.<br/><br/>The second half is more traditional and sentimental....the decent story and colourful visual makes this so grand...\n",
            "Good movie to watch with family.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Martial arts meets the MCU in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. More Crouching Tiger than Jackie Chan, the plot for the film is kinda hum-drum, the sort of mystical Eastern fantasy cobblers that practically writes itself.<br/><br/>Shang-Chi is the son of immortal, power-hungry warlord Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and Li (Fala Chen), a warrior woman from the hidden village of Ta Lo. After falling in love with Li and becoming a father, Wenwu gives up his wicked ways and packs away the ten legendary rings that gave him much of his power. However, after his wife is killed by his old enemies, Wenwu once again wears the rings and trains his son to become an assassin. Ashamed of what he has become, Shang-Chi goes into hiding in America and becomes Shaun (Simu Liu), but his past eventually catches up with him when his father sends his army, The Ten Rings, to steal the pendants given to him and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) by their mother. Wenwu requires both pendants to reveal the way to Ta Lo, where he believes that his wife is being held captive by her people.<br/><br/>This Marvel movie is at its most fun before the plot starts to get in the way and the CGI becomes too overbearing and intrusive: the early fight scenes - a battle on a runaway bus against a henchman known as Razor Fist, and a fight on some high-rise bamboo scaffolding - deliver lots of impressively choreographed action that will please both martial arts fans and superhero addicts. Awkwafina, as Shang-Chi's loyal friend Katy, provides some comic relief, but also gets stuck in with the action.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film quickly goes downhill after the good guys make their way to Ta Lo, with a little help from Tony Slattery (see Iron Man 3) and a furry winged creature with no face. The inevitable battle between the villagers and Wenwu's army is typical overblown Marvel mayhem, but the massive CGI tsunami arrives when Wenwu opens the inter-dimensional gate that he thinks is holding Li prisoner: instead of releasing his wife, he frees a swarm of flying tentacled soul-suckers and their big bad boss The Dweller. Fortunately for the Ta Lo people, they have a massive magical dragon on their side, which wakes up and adds to the digital whizz-bangery.<br/><br/>As technically impressive as the special effects are, I found the second half of the film visually overwhelming yet remarkably uninvolving - a whirlwind of pixels and noisy action without much substance.<br/><br/>5/10. It was nice to see HK/Chinese stars Michelle Yeoh, Tony Leung and Yuen Wah together in a Marvel movie; I just wish it had been a better one.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings takes place some time after Avengers Endgame is the beginning of phase four of the marvel cinematic universe.<br/><br/>Shang-Chi is an alright movie. It has some great fight scenes with some incredible fight choreography and epic large-scale battles. It is also has some good comedic scenes that made me laugh a couple of times. Where Shang-Chi suffers is when it comes to the plot. I didn't find the story very compelling and I didn't get that attached to the characters. It's a story that I feel has been done many times before.<br/><br/>Shang-Chi wasn't for me but it's comedy and fight scenes make up for some of it's flaws. If you are familiar with the Marvel franchise I assume you somewhat know what to expect and for you I can recommend it. Although the movie isn't that great, I still think it's good enough to the point of where it's worth watching just to keep up with the larger plot of the MCU. For those not invested in the MCU, I don't believe that this movie is the one you should start with.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">The best marvel movie after Endgame. The story is a bit cliché but the rest is absolutely amazing. The fight scenes are the best in the MCU in my opinion. Simu Liu as Shang-Chi is perfectly chosen and all the other characters are nice and the all the actors do a good job. Act 3 is on another level that we haven't seen before in MCU and the visual effects are spectacular, by far one of the best origin stories from Marvel!</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">It had potential but marvel has this tendency of degrading everything into mindless comedy...<br/><br/>Things just happen, to an extent where Awkwafina is now an avenger...\n",
            "I'm getting too old for this s#.t..</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Really entertaining movie. Actors were great Simu Liu brought it big time he is excellent as the main character. Awkwafina is hilarious and I wish she had more screen time. As far as Marvel movies goes, it's not the best one but still very good.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is the story of ten rings, weapons, used for thousands of years to take power and control. Shang chi ( simu liu, as chang xi ) accidentally gets pulled into the history, and can't turn back. Co-stars awkwafina, tony leung, both winners of TONS of film festival awards. Also ben kingsley... oscar for gandhi. Although he looks so different, you may not recognize kingsley in his role! It's a marvel story, from disney, so there's a good mix of adventure, violence, animation, levitation, and some jokes sprinkled here and there. The bad guys are collecting the pendants with the power, and cannot be allowed to gether them all. Surprisingly, a couple swears, giving it the PG13 rating. They meet good people that want to help them on their journey, and evil people that want to destroy them. Some fun special effects. Directed by destin cretton. Chang xi character created by steve englehart, jim starlin. It's quite good.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I really liked that the actors spoke their native language, Mandarin, because it would've felt too Americanized otherwise. But there was something unfinished about this movie and I'm not sure what it is. The pacing was alright, a little too slow or fast at times, and as far as storylines go, it was not as exciting as I thought it would be. The fight scenes were great though, especially the final grand battle scene.</div>, <div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is the worst marvel movie I have seen to date.after seeing the movie I was honestly surprised by all the high ratings. Did we watch the same thing? The movie is without a soul. Characters aren't build up enough even with a 2 hour run time. The movie literally got nothing to do with the ten rings. Movie became Godzilla vs King Kong at the end. Waste of 2 hours. Honestly clueless why people high praised for this movie. What a waste of opportunity to create a wonderful and authentic world for Asian marvel universe.</div>]\n"
