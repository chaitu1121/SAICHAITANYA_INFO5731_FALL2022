However, with online database vendors such as KR Dialog, DataStar, Medline and LEXIS‐NEXIS also moving into the Web environment, a few of which have already implemented Web‐based interfaces to assist in the online search process, the Webmaster's responsibilities might extend to that of supporting information professionals and their online search activities as well. Hence the goal and position of the Webmaster will be discussed in an effort to indicate how the Webmaster can play a role in enhancing the online search process.</p>\n",

              " <p>As libraries continue to acquire and develop collections based in digital media, they face a corresponding need to document the electronic data comprising such collections. By documentation I mean the provision of contextual information pertaining to the source, creation, processing, and current state of a digital object. When dealing with electronic text, documentation is often instinctive and unproblematic, at least in a technical sense, given that the data and its documentation (or meta‐data) both share the same medium: one documents textual data by supplementing it with more textual data (the header employed by the Text Encoding Initiative is exemplary in this regard). When libraries create digital image collections, however, documentation becomes more problematic. Even if an image is surrounded by a robust network of supporting materials, the functionality of client‐server networks such as the World‐Wide Web permits the image to become detached from its documentary apparatus. Every image encountered on the Web, is cached, at least temporarily, on the viewer's hard drive. Documentary information that is merely presented ‘alongside’ an image is left behind at that point, as it also is should the viewer choose to save a copy of the image for future reference. Given those circumstances — which are paralleled in such media as sound or video — the issue of providing reliable documentary meta‐data for non‐textual electronic files is a crucial one for digital library development.

              " <p>As libraries continue to acquire and develop collections based in digital media, they face a corresponding need to document the electronic data comprising such collections. By documentation I mean the provision of contextual information pertaining to the source, creation, processing, and current state of a digital object. When dealing with electronic text, documentation is often instinctive and unproblematic, at least in a technical sense, given that the data and its documentation (or meta‐data) both share the same medium: one documents textual data by supplementing it with more textual data (the header employed by the Text Encoding Initiative is exemplary in this regard). When libraries create digital image collections, however, documentation becomes more problematic. Even if an image is surrounded by a robust network of supporting materials, the functionality of client‐server networks such as the World‐Wide Web permits the image to become detached from its documentary apparatus. Every image encountered on the Web, is cached, at least temporarily, on the viewer's hard drive. Documentary information that is merely presented ‘alongside’ an image is left behind at that point, as it also is should the viewer choose to save a copy of the image for future reference. Given those circumstances — which are paralleled in such media as sound or video — the issue of providing reliable documentary meta‐data for non‐textual electronic files is a crucial one for digital library development. In what follows, I will present the solution adopted at the William Blake Archive, a large‐scale electronic editing project in which images — and not text — are the focal point.</p>\n",

              " <p>Recent initiatives in digital library research have suggested new models for the creation and organisation of digital information and its dissemination to virtual communities. PEN‐DOR (the Pennsylvania Education Network Digital Object Repository) is a digital library designed to provide access to the collective experience of teachers, students and administrators in public schools in building lesson plans and using curriculum materials. Using the WWW as a platform, PEN‐DOR incorporates current research in digital libraries to provide K‐12 educators with access to multimedia resources and tools to create new lesson plans and presentations, and to modify existing ones. Design problems addressed by the project include the design of a distributed, object‐oriented database architecture, the description and cataloguing of multimedia objects, and issues related to usability and training for a geographically scattered user community. Two critical aspects of the organisation of this digital library are the development of a method for the persistent identification of resources, and the design of a record structure based on recent developments in metadata. Resource identification has been achieved by adopting a system‐wide approach with an upgrade path to the emerging URN standards. In designing a record structure, the PEN‐DOR project has elected to use the GEM (Gateway to Educational Materials) metadata standard developed as part of the GEM union catalogue project. Content for the database is solicited from project partners, government agencies and educational resources Web sites, as well as from participating teachers. Once incorporated in the repository, materials can be organised in frameworks that form the basis for lessons, tutorials and presentations. As frameworks are developed, used, critiqueed and modified, they will form a community memory of past experience. Supported by the state’s Link‐to‐Learn programme, the system will function as a resource for educators throughout Pennsylvania.</p>\n",

Quality electronic teaching and research resources, which are of significant value or potential value to academics, universities and the UK Higher Education community in general, are being ceated at high levels in all types of university. However, since they are not being created with the aim of wider access and use, few are networked, most are difficult to find or in difficult to access electronic formats, and consequently are unlikely to be suitable for reuse by other institutions or even other departments in the host institution. There can also be other problems such as a lack of clarity on the copyright position of resources on university Web sites and a failure to protect potentially valuable university resources from copyright infringement. University management of services offering access to these resources within and beyond the host institution would greatly improve the value that both the host institution and UK Higher Education as a whole obtain from this material and the effort that goes into creating it – particularly if local efforts were co‐ordinated nationally to ensure resource design standardisation and service interoperability.

The concept is based on national developments within the research library sector in each of the five Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The goals of the Nordic Electronic Research Library are built on national goals, which in general terms are to make scientific and technical information easily available in all the Nordic region, independent of subject area, publication form and location of the user. This paper explores briefly the developments of the electronic research library in the Nordic region and how the concept is carried out.

              " <p>Abstract: The Nordic Electronic Research Library is a concept which NORDINFO, the Nordic Council for Scientific Information, will use as an umbrella for its activities during the coming years. The concept is based on national developments within the research library sector in each of the five Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The goals of the Nordic Electronic Research Library are built on national goals, which in general terms are to make scientific and technical information easily available in all the Nordic region, independent of subject area, publication form and location of the user. This paper explores briefly the developments of the electronic research library in the Nordic region and how the concept is carried out. NORDINFO provides grants and project money to support coordination and cooperation within the field and the question is raised as to how NORDINFO can assist this development and increase cooperative efforts.</p>\n",

For a better understanding of XML, the major features of XML are reviewed and compared with those of HTML. An experimental XML‐based metadata retrieval system, which is designed as a subsystem of the Korean Virtual Library and Information System (VINIS) is demonstrated. The metadata retrieval system consists of two modules: a retrieval module and a browsing module. The retrieval module allows the retrieval of metadata stored in Microsoft Access files and the display of search results in an XML file format, while the browse module permits browsing of metadata in XML/XSL document formats. Finally, some issues for a more efficient application of XML to digital libraries are discussed.</p>\n",

              " <p>This paper starts from the observation that the appearance of information contributes to its overall value and that, because there are many ways to represent information, it is very important to find the model which is going to be the most effective and conveys the greatest value of the original information. Appearance has always played a key role in the learning process, as it facilitates the discovery of new concepts by allowing visual association with those which are already familiar. This is why metaphors are so important in learning in general, and have therefore proved to be a valuable tool for designing alternative paradigms when adapting traditional tasks to novel environments. This paper will briefly discuss the link between paper books and their electronic counterparts. It will then focus on the role of metaphors in producing electronic books and introduce and discuss the importance of the visual rhetoric concept in driving the design process.

              " <p>From the moment the ASU Libraries migrated from dumb terminals to PC workstations for access to electronic resources, there was great concern that these workstations would be used “inappropriately”. Whether students should be allowed to check their e‐mail from the workstations was debated, as was the need to restrict access to the Internet. The Information Technology division at the University was concerned with how the Library would provide accountability for anything that happened at a public workstation. After much discussion, it was decided that the Library PC workstations would provide unrestricted access to the Internet. Telnet access was limited to library‐related resources requiring Telnet, in an effort to keep students from doing computing assignments and personal e‐mail on these workstations. The systems department developed an approach to data collection that included both an observational system and an electronic data collection system, using sampling techniques, to collect data on the use of the PC workstations at the main library (Hayden) at Arizona State University.

              " <p>From the moment the ASU Libraries migrated from dumb terminals to PC workstations for access to electronic resources, there was great concern that these workstations would be used “inappropriately”. Whether students should be allowed to check their e‐mail from the workstations was debated, as was the need to restrict access to the Internet. The Information Technology division at the University was concerned with how the Library would provide accountability for anything that happened at a public workstation. After much discussion, it was decided that the Library PC workstations would provide unrestricted access to the Internet. Telnet access was limited to library‐related resources requiring Telnet, in an effort to keep students from doing computing assignments and personal e‐mail on these workstations. The systems department developed an approach to data collection that included both an observational system and an electronic data collection system, using sampling techniques, to collect data on the use of the PC workstations at the main library (Hayden) at Arizona State University. This presentation will describe the data collection techniques, the results of data analysis, and how the results of data analysis are being used to better manage the PC workstations in the Library.</p>\n",

The Visual book study explored the importance of the visual component of the book metaphor for the production of more effective electronic books, while the WEB book study took the findings of the Visual book and applied them to the production of books for publication on the World Wide Web (WWW). Both studies started from an assessment of which kinds of paper book are more suitable for translation into electronic form. Both also identified publications which are meant to be used for reference rather than those which are read sequentially, and usually in their entirety.

The factors are: balance between need and cost of knowledge acquisition; the extent to which knowledge originates in the external environment; internal knowledge processing; internal knowledge storage; use and deployment of knowledge within the organisation; and attention to human resources. Three cases demonstrate that the fundamental concepts and principles of knowledge management are similar for small and large organisations. Differences include the value placed on systematic knowledge management practices such as formalised environmental scanning and computer‐based knowledge sharing systems.

The critical issue identified provides closer insights into issues affecting the overall utilization and management of Web‐enabled technologies, and offers many implications and challenges for businesses, governments and the user community.</p>\n",

              " <p>Discusses how technological developments in libraries have led to the emergence of new service paradigms. Reference services are receiving prime attention as librarians strategically position themselves to serve users who are entering the library both through the physical gateway and the electronic gateway. Recent trends in electronic libraries, with particular reference to academic libraries, point to the need to provide value‐added library services to support virtual communities in their access to, and use of the exploding body of electronic sources. Also discusses the dynamic nature of reference services in the context of rapidly changing technologies and heightened user expectations and explores the issues associated with planning virtual reference services in an academic environment. Outlines the service rationale, software and technology considerations taken by the Pennsylvania State University in planning towards on‐line, real‐time reference services and provides an overview of the planned pilot project.

The Health Sciences Center Library at Stony Brook University has begun deploying several technologies to develop a virtual portal of online information and services, making the library and its resources available both inside and outside the confines of the physical library. The goal of this portal is two‐fold: provide the library’s patrons – particularly the students and faculty of the University’s Medical School – with personalized access to information, and to enable the library to gather statistics on the use of electronically‐based resources. What makes this library’s portal unique is its ability to deliver, over the Internet, desktop applications specific to certain academic programs in addition to traditional library resources, such as full‐text e‐journals and databases along with a Web‐based OPAC. The technology behind this portal incorporates centralized computing and client‐server architectures with recent thin‐client and operating system technologies, such as the Independent Computing Architecture, Windows 2000, and Linux.

The key findings from national surveys of Internet use during 2000 and 2001, together with census data, provide an indication of Internet access amongst Maori. The results show there is a substantial “digital divide” between Maori and other New Zealanders, in terms of access to the Internet and employment in information technology industries. This “divide” is likely to be due to the lower household incomes and educational outcomes of Maori adults.

              " <p>We have not seen an Internet‐based game that can be identified with the arrival of Internet gaming for the masses. Due to the foundational structure of the Internet, there probably will not be one anytime soon. The problem is that the underlying Internet protocol, IPv4, has not had a major update since its introduction in the early 1970s. Fortunately, in the mid‐1990s the standards‐based Internet Engineering Task Force began addressing IPv4’s deficiencies. The result of these efforts is a new version of IPv4 called IPv6. IPv6’s entry will present the Internet gaming community with many opportunities as well as challenges. One of biggest challenges is that the rollout of IPv6 will take years for completion necessitating its coexistence with IPv4 in a number of forms. This paper focuses on issues associated with this coexistence, transition mechanisms that will be used, and what the gaming community can do today to be better positioned as IPv6 becomes the mainstream Internet protocol.</p>\n",
